            <p>Where do I even begin? There so many things to say don't know where to start. The qualities you have can light up any room and touch the hearts of everyone lucky enough to know you. 
You are without a doubt, the MOST PERFECT SON anyone could ever wish for. 
 Your love  for your family is so determined and your caring nature is evident in everything you do.
What truly sets you apart is your emotional depthâ€”a side which you don't often show, but itâ€™s there. 
Beneath your strength and practicality lies a heart that feels deeply, and itâ€™s a part of what makes you so much special for me.
But what I truly adore? You have the most sweetest and softest cheeks. Always wanting them to be pinched, radiating so much warmth and love.
