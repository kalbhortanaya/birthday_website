        <div class="box">
            <p>Where do I even begin? There are so many things to say, and I donâ€™t know where to start. The qualities you have can light up any room and touch the hearts of everyone lucky enough to know you.
                You are without a doubt the MOST PERFECT SON anyone could ever wish for.
                Your love for your family is so determined, and your caring nature is evident in everything you do.
                What truly sets you apart is your emotional depthâ€”a side which you don't often show, but itâ€™s there.
                Beneath your strength and practicality lies a heart that feels deeply, and itâ€™s a part of what makes you so special to me.
                But what I truly adore? You have the sweetest and softest cheeks. Always wanting them to be pinched, radiating so much warmth and love.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <p>Your practical approach to life is unmatched. You are such a hardworking person. Like others, you could have chosen a life full of fun and enjoyment, but you chose to work under the sun till late nights,
                every day. Leaving your comfort zone, you have started handling such big things at a small age, which is such a proud feeling. And for your hard work, you are going to get the most fruitful outcomes
                and a life that you always wanted. You are constantly becoming the best version of yourself.
                Your capability of handling complex situations and making big decisions is truly admirable. You face everything with logic, wisdom, and calm.
                Your business mind is so sharp, and your intelligence in investing and your interest in trading are truly inspiring.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <p> I wish for you to achieve unparalleled success, reaching heights beyond anyone's imagination. May you soar to the skies and beyond, inspiring everyone along the way.
                Your love for exploring the world, learning new things, and experiencing life to its fullest is truly admirable.
                The respectful nature you have toward everyone and your remarkable ability to connect with people is deeply admirable.
                Your path is filled with success, strength, and a heart full of love. Wishing you a very Happy Birthday, Swaraj! ðŸ¥³
                May you achieve all the things that you have dreamed of and have a very healthy life. Always stay happyyyyyyyy!
